    <h2><span>about </span>Code-Art</h2>
    <p><b>Code-Art - an online coding competition in association with SUMMIT'14.</b> </p>
    <p>Code-Art will test your coding, logical and analytical skills, among others. The questions are designed to be challenging, but at the same time fun to crack. We at the Code-Art team welcome you to this one-of-a-kind coding competition. :)</p>
    <p>Candidates will be provided with the same questions and they have to write the most efficient code for the problem in C/C++ for the last two rounds, and a host of programming languages are available for the first two. Your choice of language could very well determine the chances of you winning this competition!. </p>

   <div id="welcom_pan">
    <h2><span>General </span>Rules</h2>
    <p>1. The event mainly has <b>4 rounds</b>, and the difficulty level increases with each round.</p>
    <p>2. Sharing or disclosure of answers in any form is strictly banned and those who indulged in the same will be disqualified without prior notice.</p>
    <p>3. The decision of admins shall be final.</p>
    <p>4. Each round will be held around 3-4 days after which it expires. Two rounds will be active at a time.</p>
    <p>5. Inputs to the program if any, will be provided by the admins itself. So a general input set would be used for all submissions. (See IMPORTANT NOTICE below for clarification.) </p>
    <p>6. Entries submitted without a working or valid email address will be disqualified.</p>
    <p>7. Code Art team reserves the right to change or append any of the rules.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In case of TIE:<br>
    <span>Factors such as the number of times the user has submitted, the earliest submission, and such will be taken into account.</span><br>
    <span>Even then there's a tie, a tie breaking problem statement will be given and evaluated.</span></p>

   </div>
  <div id="welcom_pan">
  <h2><span>Rounds </span>1 & 2</h2>
  <p>Any programming language is allowed for this round. We support C, C++, Python, Java and Ruby.</p>
  <p>Points will be based on correct output, the time of submission (earlier the submission, more the points), as well as the execution time of your code.</p>

  </div>

   <div id="welcom_pan">
  <h2><span>Rounds </span>3 & 4</h2>
  <p>These rounds require you to use only C or C++.</p>
  <p>Points will be based on the output, time taken for execution, memory usage and efficiency of code.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="welcom_pan">
  <h2><span>Important Notice </span></h2>
  <p>Your code is tested by a computer <b>automatically,</b> not by a human being, and you have to write your code accordingly.</p>
  <p>For each problem, Code-Art will have an input set, each according to the specifications mentioned in the problem statement, and a corresponding correct output set. The output generated by your program must match the correct output <b>exactly</b> in order to be judged correct.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Some consequences of this: <br> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your program starts by printing 'Enter the number' and the problem does not tell you to do so, then since this is not part of the correct output, you will be never be judged correct regardless of what the rest of your program does.<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all that matters is that the output sets match, it makes no difference at all at what point in your program's execution that this output is written. So there is no need to read all of the input before starting output; it is much more common to just print out each result as you are reading through the input.<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use any method other than using the standard input and output streams - for example, using command line arguments, reading from a file, opening up some sort of dialog box, or otherwise - you will never be judged correct.</p>
